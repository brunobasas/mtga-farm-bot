"""Lifegain-payoff detection for the Orzhov starter deck.

The deck's engine is "gain life -> a creature grows". The payoff creatures all
share one oracle line:

    Whenever you gain life, put a +1/+1 counter on this creature.

(Ajani's Pridemate, Twinblade Paladin, Fiendish Panda.) Their value is almost
entirely a function of how many lifegain triggers they are on the board FOR, so
a turn spent not having one out is a turn of counters lost forever. That is why
the AI casts them ahead of other creatures of the same plan.

Detection is by oracle text rather than a grpId table on purpose: the deck data
holds four printings of Ajani's Pridemate and two of Twinblade Paladin (93447,
93848, 69455, 67690 / 70069, 93652), and a hand-maintained list silently misses
the next reprint. GRPIDS below is only an offline fallback for when Scryfall is
unreachable and the local DB carries no oracle text.
