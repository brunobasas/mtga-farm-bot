Free, open-source Magic the Gathering Arena (MTGA) bot for automating daily quests, daily wins, and account switching. Burning Lotus runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux without code injection or subscriptions. Built in Python with a graphical UI, no command-line knowledge required.

Feel free to inspect the code, request a feature, or report a bug via GitHub Issues or open a pull request. Discord: https://discord.gg/49j93Jz6v

## Requirements

- **OS**: Windows 10/11, macOS 12+, or Linux (X11 or Wayland; tested on Debian and CachyOS)
- **Python**: 3.10+
- **MTG Arena**: installed and running
  - Windows: Steam or Wizards installer
  - macOS: Crossover or compatible Wine layer
  - Linux: Wine/Proton via Steam or Lutris

Python dependencies are installed automatically by the launcher scripts:

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pyautogui` | Mouse/keyboard input (default backend) |
| `pynput` | Global input listener (hotkeys, macro recording) |
| `mss` | Fast screen capture |
| `opencv-python` | Template matching |
| `Pillow` | UI rendering |
| `numpy` | Numerical arrays (shared data format between mss and OpenCV) |

### Required MTGA settings (all platforms)

- `Options -> View Account -> Detailed Logs (Plugin Support)`: **ON** *(required — the bot reads `Player.log` as its primary state source)*
- `Options -> Video -> Language`: **English**
- `Options -> Video -> Display Mode`: **Windowed**
- `Options -> Video -> Resolution`: **any exact 16:9 windowed size**
- OS display scaling: **100%**

## Quick Start

Each platform has its own launcher script — named after the platform — that creates a virtual environment, installs dependencies, and starts the UI:

| Platform | Launcher |
|---|---|
| Windows | `start_windows.bat` |
| macOS | `start_macos.command` |
| Linux | `start_linux.sh` |

### Windows

1. Install Python 3.10+ from python.org (tick "Add python.exe to PATH").
2. Double-click `start_windows.bat`.

### macOS

1. Install Python 3.13 (recommended):
   - python.org installer, **or**
   - `brew install python@3.13 python-tk@3.13`
2. Optional preflight check: `./doctor_macos.command`
3. Double-click `start_macos.command` (or run `./start_macos.command` in Terminal).
4. Grant permissions to the Terminal app **and** the Python binary inside `.venv-macos`:
   - `System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility`
   - `System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Screen Recording`

### Linux

1. Install Python 3.10+ and OS-level packages:

   | Purpose | Arch / CachyOS | Debian / Ubuntu | Fedora | openSUSE |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | tkinter UI | `tk` | `python3-tk` | `python3-tkinter` | `python3-tk` |
   | MTGA window detection | `xorg-xwininfo` | `x11-utils` | `xorg-x11-utils` | `xwininfo` |
   | Screenshot (KDE) | `spectacle` | `kde-spectacle` | `spectacle` | `spectacle` |
   | Screenshot (GNOME) | `gnome-screenshot` | `gnome-screenshot` | `gnome-screenshot` | `gnome-screenshot` |
   | Screenshot (wlroots/Sway/Hyprland) | `grim` | `grim` | `grim` | `grim` |
   | Screenshot (X11 fallback) | `scrot` | `scrot` | `scrot` | `scrot` |

   The launcher warns if any required package is missing and prints the exact install command for your distro.

2. Run `./start_linux.sh`.

3. MTGA must run through Wine/Proton (Steam or Lutris). Under Wayland it goes through XWayland automatically.

### Manual start (any platform)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\pip
.venv/bin/python ui.py                       # Windows: .venv\Scripts\python ui.py
```

## Configuration

### Input backend

The bot auto-selects the best available input backend per platform:

| Platform | Default | Fallback |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | `ydotool` (if installed) | `pynput` |
| macOS | `pyautogui` | `pynput` |
| Windows | `pyautogui` | `pynput` |

Override via environment variable: `MTGA_BOT_INPUT_BACKEND=auto|pyautogui|pynput|ydotool`

`ydotool` requires `ydotoold` daemon to be running and is recommended for Linux Wayland sessions.

### Calibration (optional)

The bot locates the MTGA window automatically on startup — no manual calibration needed in most cases.

Use **Settings → Calibrate** only if the bot repeatedly fails to click the right spots. Calibration captures 1920x1080-relative coordinates and maps them to the actual window position at runtime.

## Features

### Account Switching

Accounts are stored as folders under `Accounts/` (gitignored by default):

```
Accounts/
  MyAccount/
    credentials.json   →   { "MyAccount": { "email": "...", "pw": "..." } }
  AltAccount/
    credentials.json
```

Manage accounts via **Settings → Manage Accounts**. Set a switch timer and play order. When the timer expires and the bot is at a safe screen, it logs out, switches account, and resumes.

### Quest-Based Deck Selection

After each account switch the bot picks a deck based on active quests. Place deck screenshot images in the account folder named by color letters:

- `RG.png`, `WU.png`, `B.png`, `R.png` etc. — matched to quest colors
- `C.png` — used for creature-type quests
- Random fallback if no quest matches

### Casting Logic

The bot maximizes mana usage each turn:
- Prefers the highest-value spell(s) that spend the most mana
- Respects color requirements and discounted costs
- Type priority when CMC is tied: creature → instant → sorcery → enchantment
- Supports Convoke (untapped creatures as mana sources)
- Kicker: the "Cast with Kicker?" chooser is answered automatically (always the plain, non-kicked version for now) so the bot never stalls on it

### Stopping the bot

Scroll **Mouse Wheel down** at any time to stop the bot immediately.

## Architecture

The codebase is split into clearly separated layers:

```
ui.py / run_bot.py          ← Entry points (UI or CLI)
        │
        ▼
    Game.py                 ← Session manager: connects Controller and AI,
                              handles match lifecycle (start → end → restart)
        │
   ┌────┴────┐
   ▼         ▼
Controller   DummyAI        ← AI decides what to play (generate_move / generate_keep)
   │
   ├── LogReader            ← Reads Player.log continuously, parses GRE messages
   ├── state_machine        ← Tracks bot state: HOME / IN_GAME / PLAY_MENU / ...
   ├── actions              ← Declarative action specs (navigate, click, verify)
   ├── vision               ← Screen capture (mss) + template matching (OpenCV)
   │    └── window_locator  ← Finds the MTGA window (Win32 / xwininfo / anchor search)
   └── input_controller     ← Sends mouse/keyboard input (pyautogui / pynput / ydotool)
```

**Key design principle:** `Player.log` is the primary state source — the bot reads what MTGA reports rather than inferring state from screenshots. Vision is used only to verify that clicks landed and to locate buttons when coordinates are uncertain.

**Card data** (`AI/Utilities/CardInfo.py`) is loaded from a local export of MTGA's own card database and delta-synced with the Scryfall API for missing entries.

Both `Controller` and `AI` follow an interface pattern (`ControllerInterface.py` / `AIInterface.py`) that decouples `Game.py` from the concrete implementations — making it straightforward to swap in a different AI or add a non-MTGA controller.

## Logs & Troubleshooting

| File | Location | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `bot.log` | `runtime/logs/bot.log` | Main bot debug log |
| `Player.log` | Auto-detected per OS (see below) | MTGA game log — primary state source |

`Player.log` default paths:
- **Windows**: `C:/Users/<YourUser>/AppData/LocalLow/Wizards Of The Coast/MTGA/Player.log`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Logs/Wizards Of The Coast/MTGA/Player.log`
- **Linux/Proton**: `~/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/2141910/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/AppData/LocalLow/Wizards Of The Coast/MTGA/Player.log`

If auto-detection fails, the UI prompts for a manual file selection on startup.

When something goes wrong the bot saves debug bundles under `runtime/debug/<timestamp>/` containing screenshots, the log tail, and a state dump. The entire `runtime/` tree is gitignored.
